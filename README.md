# Programming and DevOps Studies

This repository aggregates **various studies in programming, DevOps, and infrastructure**, developed through courses, hands-on labs, and technical experiments.

The main goal is to centralize smaller learning materials in a single repository, avoiding the creation of multiple fragmented repositories while keeping a well-organized learning history.

---

## Purpose

- Centralize technical studies in one repository
- Document learnings from courses, labs, and experiments
- Serve as a future reference
- Continuously improve skills in programming, DevOps, and cloud technologies

## Repository Structure

The repository structure may vary according to learning needs, but typically follows this pattern:

```text
/
├── courses/
│   ├── course-x/
│   └── course-y/
├── devops/
│   ├── docker/
│   ├── kubernetes/
│   └── ci-cd/
├── scripts/
├── tests/
└── README.md
```
Each directory may contain its own supporting files, notes, or specific README documents.

## Important Notes
This repository does not represent finished or production-ready projects

The code may include:
- Experiments
- Proofs of concept
- Quick notes and drafts

Code quality and standards may vary depending on the context of the study

## Continuous Development
This repository is continuously updated as new technologies, tools, and concepts are studied.
